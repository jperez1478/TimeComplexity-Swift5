# Time Complexity 
As data grows is important to also know the best algorithm.
Time complexity is a measure of the time required to run an algorithm as the input increases.


## Scalability
- Execution and memory usage as the input size increases. 

## Big O Notation: Excution time and memory usage

- Constant Time : same running time regardless of size in input. 

```swift
  func checkFirst(names: [String]) {
     if let first = names.first {
      print(first)
      } else {
      print("no names")
     }
  }
```
